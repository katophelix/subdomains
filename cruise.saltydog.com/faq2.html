      <p>All cruises run rain or shine and in the event of inclement weather The Salty Dog Cruise shall, at its sole
        discretion,
        determine if such conditions will cause the cancellation of any cruise or cruises. If a cruise is cancelled for
        any
        reason the Salty Dog Cruise will either reschedule passengers on the next available cruise in which spots are
        available or issue a refund. We typically make every effort to get underway. Weather often changes at the last
        moment making early cancellations nearly impossible. In the event of a cruise being cancelled more than one hour
        in
        advance, our cruise coordinator will contact you.</p>
      <h3>NEED MORE INFO?</h3>
      <p>We think we've covered most everything, but if you
